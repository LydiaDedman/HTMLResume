  <p>
    When I'm not learning how to code, I love to play video games! I also make Minecraft <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTy2BtPlETmHgzEc5_zxmPA">YouTube</a> videos.
    I love editing and trying to make each video better than the last. I play other video games like Hogwarts Legacy, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, and Minecraft Dungeons.

    I enjoy playing pickleball and going to the gym in my spare time, infact I usually start my day off with excercise, then I code.
    I also love traveling and going on hikes with my family! I want to, one day, visit each country in Europe. Reading is another one of my hobbies! I am currently reading The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien.
    Watching movies and tv shows are one of my favorite things to do. I am watching The Last Kingdom on Netflix right now, and I love it so far!
